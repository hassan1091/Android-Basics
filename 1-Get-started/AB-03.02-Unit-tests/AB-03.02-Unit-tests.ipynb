With tests in your code, you can exercise small portions of your app in isolation, and you can test in ways that are automatable and repeatable."

    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1:** Dividing by zero is always worth testing for, because it is a special case in arithmetic. How might you change the app to more gracefully handle divide by zero? To accomplish this challenge, start with a test that shows what the right behavior should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove the `divTwoNumbersZero()` method from `CalculatorTest`, and add a new unit test called `divByZeroThrows()` that tests the `div()` method with a second argument of zero, with the expected result as `IllegalArgumentException`.class. This test will pass, and as a result it will demonstrate that any division by zero will result in this exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you learn how to write code for an [Exception](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Exception.html) handler, your app can handle this exception gracefully by, for example, displaying a [Toast](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html) message to the user to change Operand 2 from zero to another number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2:** Sometimes it's difficult to isolate a unit of code from all of its external dependencies. Rather than organize your code in complicated ways just so you can test it more easily, you can use a mock framework to create fake (\"mock\") objects that pretend to be dependencies. Research the [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) framework, and learn how to set it up in Android Studio. Write a test class for the `calcButton()` method in SimpleCalc, and use Mockito to simulate the Android context in which your tests will run."
